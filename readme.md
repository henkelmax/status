# Status

A [Fabric](https://fabricmc.net/) mod that enables you to set a status.

This mod must be installed on the server. Vanilla clients are still able to join a server with this mod. If you want to
set a status, you need this mod installed on your client.

---

## Features

By pressing the `U` key, you will be able to set your status.

The status consists of multiple parts:

- The availability
    - If you don't want to get disturbed
    - If you are open for collaboration
- The base status
    - If you are recording
    - If you are streaming
- Additional stuff
    - If you don't want others to skip the night

These icons will show up next to the players head in the tab list.

If no sleep is activated, players lying in bed will see a message that someone doesn't want the night to be skipped.
This message will also be shown to players that don't have the mod installed.

When joining a server the first time in your playing session, you will get a message that will remind you to
set your status. The status is not persisted between playing sessions by default.
